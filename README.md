## My Data Analytics Project Portfolio

As a new Immigrant to Canada, I always have to dash to Google whenever I come across  *a concept or language* that might be a part of the culture for Canadians, but completely strange to me as a newbie. I would be listening to the news or reading an article *(mostly the comments section 😊)*, and comments will reference history that I have no clue about. 

*This is the inspiration behind the topics I chose to explore for my Data Analytics Project Portfolio.* 

While I want to showcase my data journey from when I thought data analysis was all about *entering data into excel spreadsheet* to how I am currently building my skills in *ETL and Visualization processes*, I am also interested in researching on Canada's history, trends, culture, environment,...the vast data all around.... 

My Data analytics projects covers Important insights and trends in *Health Sector, Transit Systems, Crime Statistics, Population Census, Wildfires, Housing Prices, Oil Sands Mining, Energy prices, Historical Data on Canadian Disasters* and much more. 

Exploring these uniquely different industries is one way to showcase the first step of the *CRISP-DM*, were *Business Understanding is crucial to Data Understanding, Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation and finally Deployment*. 

I am open to new opportunities (**my skills are: Data ETL, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, Visual Studio SSAS & SSIS, Advanced Excel Functions & Formulas**), where I can start making meaningful contributions to Canada's economy through Data-Driven Decisions, irrespective of the Business / Industry.
